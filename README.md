# 🧹 ZARA Sales Data Cleaning (2023–2024) – Excel Project

This project focuses on cleaning ZARA’s sales data for the year 2023–2024 using Microsoft Excel. Clean and structured data is essential for accurate reporting and analysis.

## ✅ Cleaning Steps Performed in Excel

1. **Identified and Handled Missing Values**  
   - Used filters and “Go To Special → Blanks” to locate and fix missing data.

2. **Removed Duplicate Rows**  
   - Applied Excel’s “Remove Duplicates” feature.

3. **Standardized Text Values**  
   - Cleaned inconsistent values in columns like Gender and Country using `PROPER()`, `UPPER()`, and `TRIM()` functions.

4. **Converted Date Formats**  
   - Ensured all dates follow a consistent `dd-mm-yyyy` format using "Format Cells".

5. **Renamed Column Headers**  
   - Made column headers clean and uniform (lowercase, no spaces, underscore format).

6. **Checked and Fixed Data Types**  
   - Verified numerical and date columns using Excel formatting and functions like `ISTEXT()` and `ISNUMBER()`.
